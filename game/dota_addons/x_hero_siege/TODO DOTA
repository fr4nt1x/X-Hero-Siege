EXTREMEM MODE IDEAS:

1) Death is permanent, ankhs still working.
2) Additional creeps (mb like heroes from vanilla) :
Type A: will explode on death dealing magic or pure damage (orcs)
Type B: active desolation debuff, like slardar's/bh's one (night elves)
Type C: disarm (humans)
Type D: decrepify (undead)
3) On illusion event 3 illusions spawns instead of one (If you enter the arena at game start you will die after exactly 3 hits, therefore 3 illusions)
4) Magnus globally casts his aoe-based fire spell since start (after some warning, like red circles on the ground when casting meteor in Diablo, you know what I mean)
